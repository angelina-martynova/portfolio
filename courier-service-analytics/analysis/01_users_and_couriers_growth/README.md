# 01 — Users and Couriers Growth

### Goal
Analyze how fast the courier service audience grows — both users and couriers — and visualize the daily dynamics.

### Metrics
- `new_users` — number of users who made their first action  
- `new_couriers` — number of couriers who made their first delivery action  
- `total_users` — cumulative users  
- `total_couriers` — cumulative couriers  

### Insights
- User base grows faster than courier base.  
- Courier growth is more stable, while user acquisition shows short spikes.  

### Visualizations
- New users vs. couriers  
- Total users vs. couriers over time
